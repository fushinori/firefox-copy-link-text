# Copy Link Text

An extremely simple add-on for Firefox that lets you copy the link text by double-clicking or double-tapping.

**IMPORTANT**

The extension may interfere with how some websites handle link clicks (including sites that use custom JavaScript navigation). Hence, it’s recommended to **keep the extension disabled by default and only enable it when you need to copy link text**. This prevents unwanted side effects while still allowing you to use the double-tap-to-copy feature when needed.
